# USCC ISA ðŸ“€

A basic ISA that simulates USCC for basic arithmetic.

The CPU will support functions:
- Add 
- Subtract
- Multiply
- Divide 
- Display a history of calculations

Each input must be in binary, and to view the result, you may call the `self.update_display()` function. 

More info about the CPU can be found on `system.py`

# Usage 

In order to the CPU, values must be placed in the register in order to use them.

To print results out, there must be past computations registered and ran by the CPU.

*Note*: Sample CPU inputs can be found at the bottom of `script.py`.
